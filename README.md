### Changes:
* all your offsets get encrypted with Joeys XOR encryption.
* header text, switch names, switch description and watermark text get obfuscated. (its pretty much as strong as base64)
* gave the default menu a new look. if you dont like it change it :)
* removed the menu icon in the header.
* changed default menu icon
* added glow to the menu. you can remove this if you want (how to do it is posted in Tweak.xm at the part where you can set the header title)
* added "TAP ME.html" for more info

* added optional watermark

* when making a new project with this template it will automatically generate encryption codes/obfuscation string so you dont have to do anything

* added a folder named "HelperFiles"
  * this folder contains 5 files. 2 for encrypting/decrypting offsets. 2 for obfuscating/deobfuscating some text.
  * tap the encrypt/obf file to encrypt/obfuscate everything 
  * tap the decrypt/deObf file to decrypt/deobfuscate everything
  * make sure that everything is obfuscated/encrypted before you compile. 

* you can easily check if everything is obfuscated/encrypted at the top of your Tweak.xm â¬‡

* added this to menu.mm. if you want to change switch height you can but i dont recommend it.
* changing the color for divider and glow is fine tho

* Customizable menu & button image icon
* 4 types of switches:
  * Offset Patcher Switch
  * Empty Switch
  * Textfield Switch
  * Slider Switch

* Backend Offset Patcher Switch is based on [KittyMemory](https://github.com/MJx0/KittyMemory)

### Installation:

You can download the template here: [Latest Release](https://github.com/joeyjurjens/iOS-Mod-Menu-Template-for-Theos/releases/latest). <br>
<b>Also follow the instructions below otherwise you will run into errors!<b> <br>
<b>iOS:</b>
1. In the makefile on line 22, you've to set the path to your SDK. This menu has been tested with the "iPhoneOS11.2.sdk" SDK from [theos/sdks](https://github.com/theos/sdks)
2. I use initializer_list in this project, iOS doesn't have this included by itself. You can download it [<b>here</b>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeyjurjens/iOS-Mod-Menu-Template-for-Theos/977e9ff2c626d6b1308eed7e17f1daf0a610e8e9/template/KittyMemory/initializer_list), save it as "initializer_list" and copy the file to: "$THEOS/sdks/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/" <br>

<b>MacOS:</b>
1. Install xCode if you haven't already.
1. In the Makefile of the project, change "MOBILE_THEOS=1" to "MOBILE_THEOS=0" on line 19 of the makefile. <br>

### Usage:

<b> Changing the menu images </b>

Inside the tweak.xm, you'll setup the menu under the function "setupMenu". 
Here you'll see two options under the menu: menuIcon & menuButton, those require a base64 image string.
In order to get a base64 string from the image, upload the image here: https://www.browserling.com/tools/image-to-base64

Images 50x50 are recommended, you can get a sample of my images by copying the standard(in tweak.xm) base64 string & use this website to show the picture: https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image

<b> Setting a framework as executable </b>
You can set this in the function setupMenu() inside Tweak.xm
```obj-c
[menu setFrameworkName:"FrameworkName"];
```

<b> Patching a offset without switch: </b>
```c
patchOffset(0x1002DB3C8, "0xC0035FD6");
patchOffset(0x10020D2D4, "0x00008052C0035FD6");

// You can write as many bytes as you want to an offset
patchOffset(0x10020D3A8, "0x00F0271E0008201EC0035FD6");
```


<b> Offset Patcher Switch: </b>
```obj-c
[switches addOffsetSwitch:@"One Hit Kill"
            description:@"Enemy will die instantly"
              offsets:{0x1001BB2C0, 0x1002CB3B0, 0x1002CB3B8}
                bytes:{"0x00E0BF12C0035FD6", "0xC0035FD6", "0x00F0271E0008201EC0035FD6"}];
```

<b> Empty Switch: </b>
```obj-c
[switches addSwitch:@"Masskill"
            description:@"Teleport all enemies to you without them knowing"];
```
<b> Textfield Switch: </b>
```obj-c
[switches addTextfieldSwitch:@"Custom Gold"
            description:@"Here you can enter your own gold amount"
              inputBorderColor:UIColorFromHex(0xBD0000)];
```
<b> Slider Switch: </b>
```obj-c
[switches addSliderSwitch:@"Custom Move Speed"
            description:@"Set your custom move speed"
              minimumValue:0
                maximumValue:10
                  sliderColor:UIColorFromHex(0xBD0000)]; 
```
<b> Checking if a switch is on:
```obj-c
bool isOn = [switches isSwitchOn:@"Switch Name Goes Here"];
    
if(isOn) {
  //Do stuff
}
    
//Or check directly:
if([switches isSwitchOn:@"Switch Name Goes Here"]) {
    // Do stuff
}
```
<b> Getting textfield or slider value: </b>
```obj-c
int userValue = [[switches getValueFromSwitch:@"Switch Name Goes Here"] intValue];
float userValue2 = [[switches getValueFromSwitch:@"Switch Name Goes Here"] floatValue];
```

The sample.xm in the project shows an example project.
